Notes:

For breadth-first, and parallel-breadth-first, getting an initial good 'best' is critical to the success of hte algorithm. Otherwise _all_ the solutions are going to be explored, and this cost both time and memory.

Depth-first is less memory-hungry and is less critical on if the 'initial best' is close to the real best.
