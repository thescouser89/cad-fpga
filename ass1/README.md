# To compile

To compile the project, simply type `make`


# To run the project

To run the project on one of the test file:

```
make

# bidirectional
./example cct3

# unidirectional
./example cct3 uni
```

# To run the project for minimum W

The program also allows you to run the code that prints the minimum W required
to be able to route everything.

To do so, follow the following instructions:

```
make

./example cct2
```

After the GUI is launched, press the 'Proceed' button. This will run the code
for the minimum W that the system can support, and the segments used.
